### This Project Is Abandoned

I could not find a free api to query snow forecasts at ski resorts. Without that data, this project is just
a telegram bot that lets you register and unregister to a list of users.

This code is all that remains of the work - the bot is not running anywhere.

### How to Use This Project

If, for some reason, you want to use this project as a starting point for your own telegram bot, you only need
to put your telegram API key in the `./token` file.

Then install dependencies with:

```bash
npm i
```

and build and run the project like so:

```bash
npm run build && \
  npm run start
```

You will need to follow instructions from elsewhere if you don't know how to set up a telegram bot.

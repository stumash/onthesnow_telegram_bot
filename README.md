### Under Construction

I recently a free ski mountain snow report api. A website it leaking it, unencrypted. This project uses it.  Maybe
in the future I'll scrape it off a website in phantom.js or something if I have to.

### How to Use This Project

If, for some reason, you want to use this project as a starting point for your own telegram bot, you only need to
put your telegram API key in the `./token` file. Follow their guides on bot creation to get the token for your bot.

Then install dependencies with:

```bash
npm i
```

and build and run the project like so:

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
```

# `stumash_onthesnow_bot`

A telegram bot that tells me when I should start planning a ski weekend at my favorite mountains
